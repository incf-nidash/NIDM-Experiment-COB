# NIDM-Experiment-COB

The possibility of data reuse is predicated upon the availability of sufficient metadata that enables the end user to understand the methods and acquisition parameters use in the acquisition and processing of that data. These metadata may come in the form of file header information, but often information not captured by the acquisition hard- or software is necessary for reuse to occur. This means that data must be annotated or tagged with additional terms that provide the missing information. 

A crucial part of data annotation is the use of unambiguous terms, and this generally requires both that the terms are defined and that terms be chosen in a manner that follows standard practice in a particular domain. In addition, to aid in the logical consistency of the term collection used to in data annotation ontologies have been created.  Ontologies can be general, such as the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), domain specific such as the Alzheimer's Disease Ontology, or foundational such as the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). 

Reusing terms from established and actively-maintained ontologies, rather than creating new terms for each project, is considered good ontological practice. Term reuse, however, is not necessarily an easy task as term tenses, variations, and how the term fits into the domain-specific ontology may determine whether it can be reused. Domain-specific terms are usually not included in existing ontologies, but rather are gathered to create a separate ontology. One potential issue for domain-specific ontologies is the lack of a sound basis or ontological view and this can lead to inconsistencies between terms which can restrict the ease or ability of expansion of the domain-specific ontology. Here we report on work to construct a sound ontological basis for the NIDM-Experiment ontology, by using as the Core Ontology for Biology and Biomedicine (COB) as the foundational term set. COB is a subset of BFO and is meant to provide a small set of common terms for domain-specific ontologies. By basing a new ontology on COB, the ontological view of the BFO is in place in the new ontology, which can both increase the possibility of term reuse in other future ontologies and help users understand the ontologyâ€™s organization and how it can be expanded or revised.
