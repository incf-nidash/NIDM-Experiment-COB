<h1>NIDM-Experiment Terms curation status</h1>You will find below a listing of the NIDM-Experiment terms that need to be curated. If you would like to help with the curation of a term, please follow those steps: first, check if the term is already under discussion in an \ 
issue and if it is please contribute to the discussion there. If not, create a new issue, including the current definition (available in  the table below) and your proposed update.

If possible, priority should be given to uncurated terms (in red).

Thank you in advance for taking part in NIDM-Experiment term curation!
